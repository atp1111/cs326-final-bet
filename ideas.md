## Innovative Idea

Have you ever been in a situation when you don't know what you want to eat? With all of the options available to you in the modern day, it can be daunting to choose even just one dish to cook. To combat this, we want to propose a recipe recommendation website, titled GrubBag, that gives the user recipes based on their own personal preferences.The user can choose to be given a recipe either daily or weekly, and using data from popular cookbook websites like AllRecipes. 
## Important Components

The website will recommend the user a randomized recipe based on their preferences on that day. If they choose to make the recipe and enjoy it, they can save the recipe to a personal collection that they amass while using the app. The food preferences can range from all-encompassing, like a recipe's length, number of ingredients, or budget, to very granular, like the number of calories, specific ingredients included, or blacklisting ingredients you don't want in your dishes. These can be changed on a daily basis, so if one night you want a recipe that's spicy, and the next you want something more short or sweet, go ahead!

## Innovative Idea

Looking to get rid of some old clothes, or change up your wardrobe on campus? With ClosetSwap, you can donate your clothes to other Five College students in the area! Using a custom made back-end for storing data, students can upload listings of clothes they want to get rid of, including parameters such as description, clothing type, size, age, quality, etc, as well as an image of the clothes and the general area of the college they selected, and using a search function, other students can look for clothes that match the parameters that they're looking for.
## Important Components

On our website when people find clothes that they like, they can message the person who uploaded the listing and ask questions about the clothes or discuss a time/place to give the clothes to them. To prevent spam or unwanted listings, a Five College email would be required to make an account for this website, a user can only have up to five individual listings up at a time, and if a listing is not taken in a month, it will be automatically unlisted.
